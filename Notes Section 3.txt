03-61. Important Note Regarding Node v17
FROM node:16-alpine

Currently, there is a critical bug in many libraries such as Webpack and Create React App 
caused by the release of Node v17.

https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/11562 (still unresolved)
https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/14532 (currently resolved)

If you need to support both 17 and older NodeJS versions you can use if-node-version 
to execute different commands for different NodeJS versions:

{
    "scripts": {
        "build": "if-node-version '>= 17' && react-scripts --openssl-legacy-provider build || react-scripts build",
    }
}
